## Database pricing: 

## Sql Database:

Serverless compute: 6,0$

No server provided, we made a test one with 4-8 Virtual cores  and 4 CPUs. We also used 12 GB of storage. We also put the usage time of 3600 seconds(1 hour). 

Provisioned compute: 1498,97$ /Month

This server works with a provisioned server and uses similar specs to the Database above. It has some more processing power though. 

Manged instance:



## MariaDB:

*Basic database: 53,14 $ / month*

The basic database is like its name suggests, a small database with 5 gb of storage and not a lot of processing power.

*General use Database: 154,13 $ / month*

A database for general use, its got 20 gb of storage and has more processing power then the preivious one. This one also has a backup that costs 11$/month. 



## MySQL:

Same prices as MariaDB, almost no difference for the different configs. 

## CosmosDB:

Regular CosmosDB" - 28,36 $ / month

A small cosmosDB located in Northen Europe with no connection to another Region. It has 20 gb or storage and full support. If you want to add another region to write from, the price roughly doubles

## Setting up an Azure Database

Now that we have discussed prices for different databases on Azure, lets starting setting up one. The first thing you will need is to have a Azure account set up just like we needed in the previous tutorials. 

a SQL database in azure, you can do this either from the portal or the CLI and we are going to show you how to do it from the CLI. 

In the CLI you first need to login to your Azure Account. Once you are logged in you can either create a resource group, like the example code below or you can use an existing resource group: 

```azurecli
az group create --name $resource --location "$location"
```

Once you have your resource group enter the following command to create your database: 

```azurecli
az sql server create --name $server --resource-group $resource --location "$location" --admin-user $login --admin-password $password

az sql server firewall-rule create --resource-group $resource --server $server -n AllowYourIp --start-ip-address $startIP --end-ip-address $endIP

az sql db create -g mygroup -s myserver -n mydb -e GeneralPurpose -f Gen5 -c 2 --compute-model Serverless --auto-pause-delay 120
```

The first command will create the server that your database will run on, the second command will then set a firewall rule to allow certain ip-addresses to access your database. Here you need to add your own IP if you want to be able to connect to it. The last command then creates the database itself and after these commands have gone trough you can view your new database in the Azure Portal.

To view your connection string for this database you can do so in the Azure portal by selecting your database and selectin "Connection string". You can use this connection string in any application that uses a database to test it. Just remember to allow your IP address so that you can access the database without any problems!
