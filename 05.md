## Database pricing: 

## Sql Database:

Serverless compute: 6,0$

No server provided, we made a test one with 4-8 Virtual cores  and 4 CPUs. We also used 12 GB of storage. We also put the usage time of 3600 seconds(1 hour). 

Provisioned compute: 1498,97$ /Month

This server works with a provisioned server and uses similar specs to the Database above. It has some more processing power though. 

Manged instance:



## MariaDB:

*Basic database: 53,14 $ / month*

The basic database is like its name suggests, a small database with 5 gb of storage and not a lot of processing power.

*General use Database: 154,13 $ / month*

A database for general use, its got 20 gb of storage and has more processing power then the preivious one. This one also has a backup that costs 11$/month. 



## MySQL:

Same prices as MariaDB, almost no difference for the different configs. 

## CosmosDB:
