# Blog entry 09 - Log in application





## Logging to Console

To log into the console of an application, there isnt really much you have to do. To do this, you can simply use any application that you already have. We are going to be using "ILogger" in this example  and to get started you will need to add a using statement for ILogger. simply add the follow code to the top of your application. 

```c#
using Microsoft.Extensions.Logging;
```

After this you need to set up you logger, you can do it the following way:

```csharp
  public AboutModel(ILogger<AboutModel> logger)
    {
        _logger = logger;
    }
```

After this, simple call your logger whenever you want to log something, like this: 

```csharp
public void OnGet()
    {
        Message = $"About page visited at {DateTime.UtcNow.ToLongTimeString()}";
        _logger.LogInformation(Message);
    }
```

This code snippet here will log the entire string "Message" whenever the methods starts and display it in your applications console. This might not be the best thing to log in a production application, especially if you are only logging this information in the console. But this is how you get started with console logging and how you can add display it in your console.



## Logging to Application insights

Now are going to move on and start sending our logs to the cloud. For this example we will be using Azure application Insight to log and display our console apps logs. We will be using the following example code to get started:

```csharp
static void Main(string[] args)
{
    //TODO: log "Hello World!"
    var rand = new Random();
    bool runApp = true;
    Console.WriteLine("Press any key for pretty exit");
    while(runApp){
        int randomSleep = rand.Next(1, 50);
        //TODO: log "Sleeping for 2.7 seconds"
        //NOTE: use the SleepTimeToSec method to make the randomSleep human readable
        Thread.Sleep(randomSleep*100);
        //TODO: log "Send data to Azure"
        //TODO: send telemetry eg. "Telemetry data"
        if(Console.KeyAvailable){
            Console.ReadKey(true);
            runApp = false;
        }
    }
    //TODO: log "Exit"
}

static double SleepTimeToSec(int sleeptime){
    double realtime = (double)sleeptime / 10;
    return realtime;
}
```

Now the first thing we need to get started is to set up an application insights service in Azure, the easiest way to do so would be to do it from the Azure Portal. Once this is done you want to write down your InstrumentKey, this will function as your connectionstring to insight. After this we will need to install 3 NuGet packages, you can add in the following using statements and from Visual studio install the nugets: 

```csharp
using Microsoft.ApplicationInsights;
using Microsoft.ApplicationInsights.DependencyCollector;
using Microsoft.ApplicationInsights.Extensibility;
```

Now that this is done, we can start to set up our connection, first we are going to add in the following pieces of code: 

```csharp
 TelemetryConfiguration configuration = TelemetryConfiguration.CreateDefault();
            configuration.InstrumentationKey = "Connection to Azure here";
            configuration.TelemetryInitializers.Add(new HttpDependenciesParsingTelemetryInitializer());
            var telemetryClient = new TelemetryClient(configuration);
```

This will set up your connection to Azure and to set up an Telemetry Client which will talk to your insight service. The next step will be to define your Telemetry Module with the following piece of code: 

```csharp
 static DependencyTrackingTelemetryModule InitializeDependencyTracking(TelemetryConfiguration configuration)
        {
            var module = new DependencyTrackingTelemetryModule();
            module.ExcludeComponentCorrelationHttpHeadersOnDomains.Add("core.windows.net");

​        module.Initialize(configuration);
​        return module;
​    }
```

We will put this at the end of our code, under the main method. This is simply to define the telemtry module. The next step after this is to edit our previous code to look like this: 

```csharp
 using (InitializeDependencyTracking(configuration))
            {
                telemetryClient.TrackTrace("Hello World!");
                var rand = new Random();
                bool runApp = true;
                Console.WriteLine("Press any key for pretty exit");
                while (runApp)
                {
                    int randomSleep = rand.Next(1, 50);

​                //TODO: log "Sleeping for 2.7 seconds"
​                telemetryClient.TrackTrace($"Sleeping for {randomSleep * 100} seconds");
​                Thread.Sleep(randomSleep * 100);
​                //TODO: log "Send data to Azure"
​                telemetryClient.TrackTrace("sending data to Azure");
​                //TODO: send telemetry eg. "Telemetry data"

​                if (Console.KeyAvailable)
​                {
​                    Console.ReadKey(true);
​                    runApp = false;
​                }
​            }
​        }
​        //TODO: log "Exit"
​        telemetryClient.TrackTrace("Exit");

​        telemetryClient.Flush();
​        Thread.Sleep(5000);
}
```



Inside of the using statement is where we actually do all of our logging. What happens here is that our Telemetry client is logging all the events we want it to log with "TrackTrace" that it is doing in several parts of the code. Here we are only trying to log the most important parts as well as a "Hello World" just to test the logging. At the end of the code you can see that we are doing a "Flush". What this will do is close down our connection and send all of our loggs the application insight for it to display. This can then be displayed later inside of out application insight as a "TrackTrace". 



And thats how you can simply add some Telemetry logging into your application and send it to the Cloud.
