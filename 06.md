Virtual Machine:

145$ / month - This calculation was done with a  standard model on a windows VM, good enough to host a smaller website. If we needed to host something bigger we would need a more powerful VM and that would increase the price by a lot. 

80$ /month - This calculation was done with a standard model on a Ubuntu VM, same specs as the above VM. 

App Service

54 $ / month - For a Windows App service with basic Tier and with low specs. 

13.14 $ / month - For a Linux App service with the same specs as above

Azure Container Instance

0.09 $ /month - For a smaller container Instance running on Linux. This is the cheapest option but for this you also need a container registry, which is also very cheap. If you use windows instead it doubles the price.

Kubernetes

78 $ / month - Similar price for a linux VM, using similiar specs as the linux VM above. 



## Website in Azure using Web App Service

To get deploy one of your apps to the web you can use many different resources and today we are going to take a look at one of these ways, Azure Web app service. Before you start working with this, make sure that you have a container registry set up with your app in a container. We went over how to do this in tutorial number 4. 

Now then, the first step after your container is uploaded to the Azure container registry, is to create a Web app. You can either do this from the CLI or from the Azure portal. We are going to do if from the Azure portal. 

First head over to create a new resource and select "Web app". For the first window that pops up select what resource group you will be working in and what you want to name your app. Then click on "next" to move on.

On the "Docker" page, you want to first select the source for your image. In our case, this will be from an Azure Container Registry, so select this option and then select your registry. Choose which Image you want to work with and what version of it. After this you don't need to configure anything else and can just move onto "Review and Create" and the Create your Web app.

Now that your Web app is created, head over to the "All Resources" page in Azure and go to your newly created web app. When you are in your web apps resource page, you can either copy the websites address to preview it or you can select "browse" to directly open a new window to it. 

And there you have it! this is how you create a web app in Azure and how to view it.
