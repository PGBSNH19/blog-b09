<h2>Installing Docker Desktop

> Docker is an open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications. Docker enables you to separate your applications from your infrastructure so you can deliver software quickly. With Docker, you can manage your infrastructure in the same ways you manage your applications. By taking advantage of Docker’s methodologies for shipping, testing, and deploying code quickly, you can significantly reduce the delay between writing code and running it in production.

<h3> Windows 10 64-bit: Pro, Enterprise or Education

Before installing docker desktop certain functions within your OS must be enabled.

* Hyper-V must be enabled, this is enabled via BIOS where we found this walkthrough helpful as it differs on what manufacturer you have on your PC/Laptop. https://2nwiki.2n.cz/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=75202968
* Follow the instructions to install the software

<h3> Windows 10 Home

Before installing docker desktop you must make sure the following version of your OS Windows 2004 or higher.

If this requirement is meet you can simply install the software.

## How to put an app into a container (?)

Now that you have installed docker its time to start putting your project in a container. First we need a project to work with, you can either use one of your own projects or you can use this example project: https://github.com/skjohansen/SimpleWebHalloWorld

* Before we can start using docker we need to publish our project, the easiest way to publish our project is to do it from the terminal. First we need to navigate into our project folder and then use the following command:

  > dotnet publish --configuration Release

  

* This will create a .dll file from your project which we will need to put into a container.

* Now we need to create something called a Dockerfile. A Dockerfile is a text document that contains all the information and commands docker will need to create a container from a project.

* We can either create a new textfile in the root folder of our project and call it “Dockerfile” or if we are using visual studio, we can add something called “Docker support” into our project. If you choose to add this you will get a pre-built docker file with most of the information it needs. Next we need enter the following text into our Dockerfile: 

  >FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/aspnet:3.1-buster-slim AS base
  >
  >WORKDIR /app
  >
  >EXPOSE 80
  >
  >EXPOSE 443
  >
  >
  >
  >FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/sdk:3.1-buster AS build
  >
  >WORKDIR /src
  >
  >COPY ["SimpleWebHalloWorld.csproj", "./"]
  >
  >RUN dotnet restore "SimpleWebHalloWorld.csproj"
  >
  >COPY . .
  >
  >WORKDIR "/src/"
  >
  >RUN dotnet build "SimpleWebHalloWorld.csproj" -c Release -o /app/build
  >
  >
  >
  >FROM build AS publish
  >
  >RUN dotnet publish "SimpleWebHalloWorld.csproj" -c Release -o /app/publish
  >
  >
  >
  >FROM base AS final
  >
  >WORKDIR /app
  >
  >COPY --from=publish /app/publish .
  >
  >ENTRYPOINT ["dotnet", "SimpleWebHalloWorld.dll"]

  

* If you are using your own project you will need to change out some names in this text, so that it works with the application you want.

* After this we are going to go back into the terminal and enter the following command to build an image of our container: 

  > docker build -t <name of image> .

  

* After this we can enter this command to see all of our images: 

  > docker image ls

  

* Now that our image is built, it’s time to create a container from it and test it. We are going to run the following command: 

  >docker run -d -p 8080:80 --name <name of container> <name of image>o

  

* This will create a container from the image you want it to, just make sure that you enter the right name. It will also run the newly created container on port 8080, you can change this by entering whatever port you want it to run on.

* Then we can use this command to display all of our running containers :

  > docker ps

  

* Now go into your browser and try to connect to your container, if you are using our example you should see the lovely hello world page.

* Then to stop our container from running we use this command:

  > docker stop <name of container>

  

* we can also start it up again with this command: 

  > docker start <name of container>

  

* Now you have successfully created a container from your application and started it up to run locally on your machine!

## Creating a Docker Compose

Docker compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container applications. It uses a YAML file to configure the applications services. In this example we will continue on the previous example and use compose to run our application that only includes one container. 

* Firstly, we need to create our docker-compose file, as mentioned above it needs to be a YAML file and can be created manually in the root folder of your project. Note that you must name the file “docker-compose.yml”. If you are using visual studio for your project you can also add it into your project by selecting “Container orchestration support”. This will already be filled out with information that we will not need for this example.

* After you have created your compose file all you need to add into it for this example is the following: 

  > version: '3.4'
  >
  > services:
  >
  > ​	 <name of container>:
  >
  > ​		image: "<name of image>"
  >
  > ​		build: context: .
  >
  > ​		dockerfile: Dockerfile
  >
  > ​		ports:
  >
  > ​		-"8080:80"

  

* This will define how our container should be built and runned. Since we are only going to be working with one container this text will be very small, but if you are working with several containers you will need to add more information. You can read more about it here: https://docs.docker.com/compose/

* Now that we have defined how to build our container we can jump into the terminal and write the following command: 

  > docker-compose up

  

* Now you have created a new container and started it up locally on your machine!
