## Arguments for using Azure Service Bus:

Azure Service Bus is a way for us to start modernizing and optimizing our current applications. When we are using Azure, we don't need to send any data over the public internet, we have options to not do so. If we want to we can use a VPN connection to the Virtual network on Azure, this will then be sent over the public net or we can use one of Azure's services called "Expressroute". Expressroute doesn't use the public internet and instead uses a private internet to send information between our on-premises network to Azure's Virtual Network. With this service we can set up a connection to Azure straight from our WAN network and not have to worry about sending data over the public internet. 

Once we have a connection up and running to Azure, we can use almost endless resource to scale up our applications and not have to worry about the Hardware costs. This will of course come with a price tag, but it should still be a cheaper solution then expanding and maintaining our on-premise services. When using a virutal network we can also set up Firewalls and configure them just like any other Firewall, as well as making sure only our on-premise application is allowed to access the virtual network.
