Blog entry 04 - Pipelines



Intro goes here



## CI Pipeline

Now its time to start setting up our pipeline. Since we will be building our Pipeline in Azure Devops, you first need to  make sure that you have an account and then start a new public project. After this, you can jump in to the Pipelines section and click "New pipeline".

- First we will be prompted to connect our Devops to an other service, since we are keeping our code on GitHub we will login in on there. 

- Next we will be asked to select a repository that we want to work with, We will be using the HalloWorld project used in previous Articles, if you want to fork it and work with here is the link: https://github.com/skjohansen/SimpleWebHalloWorld

- After this, you might be redirected to GitHub again to install the Azure Pipelines app, if that is the case select "Approve & install".

- Now its time to configure our YAML file, there are hundreds of templates to use and we recommend that you look at the ones that relevant to your project later on. But for now all we need to do is select the default one, since we will provide you with our configuration anyway. 

- After you have configured your pipeline simply press "next" and and time to start editing our YAML file. This can be done in the Azure devops portal or it can be done locally in your repository. 

- This is what our config file looks like in the Devops portal: ![image-20200911100629032](C:\Users\Jones\AppData\Roaming\Typora\typora-user-images\image-20200911100629032.png)

  - Now what does all of this mean? First we have our "triggers", this decides when the pipeline should start. We put this on trigger as we wanted our pipeline to run each time we make a commit to master. After this we have what's called a "pool", this decides on what OS your pipeline should run in. Since we are used to working with an Ubuntu-VM and have our Docker file configured for the same, we will set this as Ubuntu. 

    Next up we have our Variable which will define our build Configuration and we put this as "Release". Now we are starting to get into the fun parts, Tasks. Tasks define what task the pipeline is gonna run and how they are going to run them. First up we install NuGet Tool and this is so that we can run a NuGet Restore on the entire project. Once that is completed we are going to run a Build command from the Dot Net core CLI. We simply add the command Build and on what file we to build, we specified it so that the Pipeline found the right cs.proj file. After this we run a similar command but instead of building the project we run the "Test"-command, this will run all our tests. Now you don't have to run this if you don't have any tests in your project, but for testing purposes we added it.  

    Now that we have everything we need in our YAML file, all you need to do is save and then run the pipeline. If there aren't any mistakes in the code you should get a result like this: ![image-20200911101834909](C:\Users\Jones\AppData\Roaming\Typora\typora-user-images\image-20200911101834909.png)

  Great job! Now you have small pipeline that builds and test your project after each push into the master branch. Next we are gonna look at how you can push this up to an Azure container Registry.

## CD Pipeline 

Since we are now gonna push project up to a Azure container Registry, the first thing we need to do is make sure that we are connected to our Azure account. If you are using the same login on Devops as on the Azure portal, this shouldn't be a problem. First you need to head into "Project settings" on the Devops homepage, its located in the bottom left corner. Then you can select "Service connections" and "New service connection". Since we are going to be using Docker to publish our project, select Docker Registry and choose the registry you want to use. Now, if you haven't set up a Container Registry before, don't worry. We will go through that process right now! 

To set up your registry you can either do it from the azure Portal or from the Azure CLI. We are going to be doing from the Azure CLI. Make sure that you have installed the CLI before doing this. 

- The first step is to Create a resource group, to do is from the CLI you first need to login on azure. Once you are logged in use the following command:

  ```azurecli
  az group create --name myResourceGroup --location eastus
  ```

- Now its time to create the registry in the resource group you created, here is the command you need to use:                  

```azurecli
    az acr create --resource-group myResourceGroup \
      --name myContainerRegistry007 --sku Basic
```

- After this has been done you can log into the Azure portal and see your new container Registry. Since we are going to be doing everything else Devops there is no need to do anything further in the portal or CLI. 
- Now that we have our registry set up and connected to Devops, lets hop back into our YAML file and edit it. 
- We are now going to build out the YAML file that we created for the CL pipeline so that it can create an image from our project and push it up to our container registry. Since we have connected our registry to Devops we dont need to worry about passwords or any connection string, here is what we added to our YAML file: ![image-20200911103602579](C:\Users\Jones\AppData\Roaming\Typora\typora-user-images\image-20200911103602579.png)

- First we added a "publish" command to publish our project, since we need to work with a .DLL file to create an image. After this we add a task from Docker called "Build and Push". This commands builds our project as an image and pushes it up to our registry in the repository of our choosing. When we added our Container registry as a registered service in Devops we can get the option to simply select which Container Registry we want to work it, instead of having to deal with logins and connections to reach it. Then we also choose which repo in the registry we want to save our image in. As you can see we are also selecting a Dockerfile and this is the Dockerfile that we created and worked with in our article about Container (add link to blogg 3). The image we create will be pushed up with our BuildID as its name, this can be done by adding a tag specifying it or we can add it in when we create the task from the menu to the left side of the editor. 

  

  There we go! Now you have successfully created a small pipeline to directly push your project into a container registry after each push on the master branch of you project.
